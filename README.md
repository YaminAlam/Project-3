# Image Classification: Indoor/Outdoor Recognition
Machine Learning Project

Creating a neural network machine learning model to predict whether an image was taken indoor or outdoors. The model is trained on 1400 images classified evenly between indoor and outdoor. Those images were downloaded using the flickr api. 

The main.py, downloader.py, and flickr.py are used to download the dataset, and these files will need to be placed in the same directory as the notebook. Execute the main.py in the python shell.
